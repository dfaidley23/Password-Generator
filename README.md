## Credits
Credits for this sites creation goes to the DU course I am currently attending as well as the following:
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- My Tutor Dru who helped me with the structure of the generator (the checkboxs) as well as helping me keep my code very minimal but that still gets the app up.

## Tests
To test the site please feel free to check or uncheck the boxs that specify what characters you would like your new password to contain. After that you will then click the generate password button. This should prompt you to enter in the length you want your new password to be.
If you see any areas that could use improvment pleae be sure to reach ot to me and I will be more than happy to make those changes.
