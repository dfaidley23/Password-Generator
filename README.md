# Password Generator

## Description
The purpose of this site is to have a working Password generator. it is to be used by anyone who wishes to make a new and fully randomized password to use for whatever purpose they see fit.
Also this generator has been customized to have only one prompt on the page with boxs to ask for criteria to be included in the password due to most browsers asking to block prompts from occuring one a website if you start receiving multiple prompts in a single session.

## Credits
Credits for this sites creation goes to the DU course I am currently attending as well as the following:
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- My Tutor Dru who helped me with the structure of the generator (the checkboxs) as well as helping me keep my code very minimal but that still gets the app up.

## Tests
To test the site please feel free to check or uncheck the boxs that specify what characters you would like your new password to contain. After that you will then click the generate password button. This should prompt you to enter in the length you want your new password to be.
If you see any areas that could use improvment pleae be sure to reach ot to me and I will be more than happy to make those changes.
